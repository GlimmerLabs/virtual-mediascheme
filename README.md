===================

Information on the Virtual Machine for Mediascheme.

A full copy of the virtual machine for Mediascheme is not hosted on GitHub 
because it's too large (2+ gb).  This repository contains information on
that virtual machine.

`README.md` - The file you are reading right now.

`UserGuide.md` - The basic user guide for the virtual machine.  The
user guide assumes that you know a bit about Mediascheme.  (Check out
Grinnell's CSC 151 course for more information about Mediascheme.)

`Building.md` - A basic guide for building a new virtual machine.
These instructions assume that you know a bit about virtual box and
Linux installation.

`Desktop` - Files that traditionally go on the desktop of a new CSC 151
machine.

`Desktop/kitten.jpg` - A photograph of a kitten that we use in a
variety of examples.  The photograph was released for public use
at <http://public-photo.net/displayimage-2485.html>. It appears that
site is now down.

`Desktop/oval.rkt` - A simple Mediascheme program that draws an oval.
Intended as a quick check that things are working.

`Desktop/sample-turtle.rkt` - Another simple Mediascheme program that
is intended as a quick check that things are working.  This one uses 
the turtle graphics commands.

`Desktop/show-kitten.rkt` - Yet another simple Mediascheme program that
is intended as a quick check that things are working.  This one simply
shows the kitten image mentioned above.
